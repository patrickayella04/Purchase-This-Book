This stripe application contains code that allows payments to be made to develper stripe but has been disabled. When enabled, the post request to stripe is possible through the local server. Currently, for the purpose of building a personal mock project, payments can be submited where the user will still be directed to the purchased summary page automatically. A future improvement will be to connect stripe to a server that can allow the application to be used remotely on multiple devices.
